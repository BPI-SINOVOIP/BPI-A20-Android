    <!-- The "Call Card", which displays info about the currently
         active phone call(s) on the device.  See call_card.xml.

         Note that the CallCard is technically the size of the full screen
         (since layout_width and layout_height are both "match_parent" here) but
         we manually adjust its bottom margin in CallCard.updateCallInfoLayout()
         to make sure it doesn't overlap with the onscreen buttons from
         incall_touch_ui.xml. -->

         visible, covers the upper part of the screen too.) -->

         at the bottom of the screen.  The regular CallCard and the
         InCallTouchUi widget are not used at all during an OTASP call. -->
