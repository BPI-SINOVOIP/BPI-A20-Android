# The libffi code is organized primarily by architecture, but at some
# point OS-specific issues started to creep in. In some cases there
# are OS-specific source files, in others there are just #ifdefs in
# the code. We need to generate the appropriate defines and select the
# right set of source files for the OS and architecture.
