Local modifications:
- Rewrite Android.mk to remove duplicate definitions and set module name
  in a consistent way with other external libraries
- Move public headers from src/webp to include/webp, so path to headers
  may be appended into CFLAGS without risk for other private headers
  (e.g. bits.h) to leak into
- Sync-patch with libwebp ver 0.1.2
- Removed Build files necessary for building via autoconf/automake tools
  These files are not required to build via Android.mk
  - Makefile.am  Makefile.vc Makefile.in
  - config.h.in configure config.guess config.sub configure.ac
  - autogen.sh install-sh missing depcomp ltmain.sh aclocal.m4
- Added WebP Encoder (ver 0.1.2) as well
  - Removed some more unused Makefile.am & Makefile.in
  - Added Android.mk to encoder & decoder code levels.
- Synced the WebP Code (Encoder/Decoder) with the head change#Ia53f845b
  - Added three color-spaces viz ARGB_8888, RGBA_4444, RGB_565
    supported by Android.
- Fixed the Endian'ness bug for Color-Configs (RGB_565 & ARGB_4444).
  The fix is similar to jpeglib handling for JCS_RGB_565 & JCS_RGBA_8888
  color configs. Added the code under "ANDROID_WEBP_RGB" flag.
- Sync-patch with libwebp ver 0.2.0 (head change#I3da2063b).

The Android.mk file creates WebP Decoder and Encoder static libraries which
can be added to any application by Adding to LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES
libwebp-decode libwebp-encode:

  LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES += libwebp-decode libwebp-encode
