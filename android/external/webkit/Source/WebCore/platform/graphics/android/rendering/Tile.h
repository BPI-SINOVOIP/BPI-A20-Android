/**
 * An individual tile that is used to construct part of a webpage's BaseLayer of
 * content.  Each tile is assigned to a TiledPage and is responsible for drawing
 * and displaying their section of the page.  The lifecycle of a tile is:
 *
 * 1. Each tile is created on the main GL thread and assigned to a specific
 *    location within a TiledPage.
 * 2. When needed the tile is passed to the background thread where it paints
 *    the BaseLayer's most recent PictureSet to a bitmap which is then uploaded
 *    to the GPU.
 * 3. After the bitmap is uploaded to the GPU the main GL thread then uses the
 *    tile's drawGL() function to display the tile to the screen.
 * 4. Steps 2-3 are repeated as necessary.
 * 5. The tile is destroyed when the user navigates to a new page.
