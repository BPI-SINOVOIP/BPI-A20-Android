 * Uses Bullet Physics Heightfield terrain collision system. This is MUCH faster
 * than using a regular mesh.
 * There are a couple tricks though:
 *	-No rotation or translation is supported.
 *	-The collision bbox must be centered around 0,0,0 with the height above and below the y-axis being
 *	equal on either side. If not, the whole collision box is shifted vertically and things don't collide
 *	as they should.
