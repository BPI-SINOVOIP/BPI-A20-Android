Ganymed SSH2 for Java is a library which implements the SSH-2 protocol in pure Java.
It allows one to connect to SSH servers from within Java programs. It supports SSH sessions
(remote command execution and shell access),
local and remote port forwarding, local stream forwarding, X11 forwarding, SCP and SFTP.
There are no dependencies on any JCE provider, as all crypto functionality is included.
<p>
Ganymed SSH2 for Java was first developed for the Ganymed replication project and a
couple of other projects at the IKS group at ETH Zurich.
