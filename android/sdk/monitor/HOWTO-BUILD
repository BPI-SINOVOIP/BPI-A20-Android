To build the Monitor RCP based application, do:

$ lunch sdk-eng
$ ./sdk/eclipse/scripts/create_all_symlinks.sh
$ cd sdk/monitor
$ ant

This will build the RCP for all the platforms in the folder:
$ANDROID_SRC/out/host/eclipse/rcp/build/I.RcpBuild/

To build only a subset of platforms, use:

ant -DbuildFor=<platform>

where platform is one of linux, darwin or windows.
